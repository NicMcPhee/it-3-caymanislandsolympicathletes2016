This is Team Nicolai Th√§richen's iteration-one code for the DoorBoard web app,
as part of The UMM CSCI Department's "Software Design and Development" class
(Spring 2020).

DoorBoard is a virtual sticky-note board for office dwellers who need a way to
remotely and conveniently post last minute scheduling announcements (or other
information) to visitors.

## Deployment

As always, instructions on how to crate a DigitalOcean Droplet and setup the project are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
